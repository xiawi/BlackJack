# BlackJack
A BlackJack game created for an Object-Oriented Programming class. One of the first times working with UI. I did this in a time crunch, I'm proud of this.

## Features
- A simple start menu
- Dealer behaviour
- Singleplayer gameplay
- Animations and media to enhance gameplay experience.
- Quality of Life features (hover over cards).
## Drawbacks
- Since I had to do this in a timecrunch, the code was extremely messy.
- Lots of places where OOP principles could be applied were ignored just so I could deliver something functioning.
## What I learn
I enjoy working with graphical and sound elements, and procrastination is generally just not a great idea.
